# ORB\_SLAM2\_with\_OctoMap

This is a modified [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2)\(Raul Mur-Artal's opensource project\), with a online point clund map running in RGBD mode\(with and without ROS\), and generating a octomap too\(Not runing time now, but it will be soon\). Besides, the STEREO with ROS has modified for MAV based on PIXHAWK.

## How to install & run

Just follow the instruction of [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2).

At the bottom of \/Examples\/RGB-D\/TUMx.yaml, some parameters added to control point cloud mapping or not, and the resolution.
